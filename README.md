This was an Idea I had at due to the current work place I am at. We have so many issues with tracking inventory and selling incorrectly. Unfortunatly I did not get it working to the extent that I had planned on getting it in this final weeks of class. But it shows a great building block and as I continute to work on it and develop it even more it will become a wonderful thing.
